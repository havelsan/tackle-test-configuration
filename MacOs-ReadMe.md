# Tackle-Test Configuration for MacOS Users

## Required Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that the appropriate versions of the following programs are installed in your system.
- **Python:** Versions 3.9 or newer are supported. 
- **Java Development Kit:** Versions 8-11 or newer are supported, JDK-11 is more preferable.
  JDK-11 can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#license-lightbox) ARM64, and [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#license-lightbox) for X64.
- **Build Automation Tool:** One of the Gradle, Ant or Maven software must be installed on the system. The following parts of the project were progressed using Gradle. Click [here](https://gradle.org/install/) for more information about installing Gradle.

## Gradle Part

### Creating `build.gradle`

To compile the Java project, the `build.gradle` file is created in the root directory. The compilation process can be personalized by making changes to the `build.gradle` provided as a template.

```groovy

plugins {
    id 'java' // Applies the Java plugin to the project
    id 'application' // Applies the Application plugin to the project
}

group 'com.example' // Defines the group ID for the project
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT' // Defines the version of the project

sourceCompatibility = '11' // Sets the Java source compatibility to Java 11

repositories {
    mavenCentral() // Specifies Maven Central as the repository to fetch dependencies from
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-api:5.7.0' // Adds JUnit Jupiter API as a test implementation dependency
    testRuntimeOnly 'org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter-engine:5.7.0' // Adds JUnit Jupiter Engine as a test runtime-only dependency
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform() // Configures the test task to use the JUnit Platform
}

application {
    mainClassName = 'Game._Lancher' // Specifies the main class for the application
}

sourceSets {
    main {
        java {
            srcDirs = ['src'] // Sets the source directory for Java files
        }
        resources {
            srcDirs = ['src'] // Sets the source directory for resource files
        }
    }
}

jar {
    manifest {
        attributes(
            'Main-Class': 'Game._Lancher' // Sets the main class attribute in the JAR manifest
        )
    }
}
```




### Building Project

To build the project, go to the directory where the build.gradle file is located via the terminal and use the code given below.
```sh
gradle build
```
 

### Running Project

After the build process, code in below is used to run the application.
```sh
gradle run
```

## Tackle-Test Installation
There are multiple options for installation, by visiting [this](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-test-generator-cli/releases) link and downloading
`tackle-test-generator-cli-v2.4.5-all-deps.zip` file, installation can be done in the easiest way by downloading the file containing all dependencies.
After the download is completed, use the terminal to go to the directory where the downloaded file is located, and run the code below through the terminal.
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --editable .
```
With this step, Tackle-Test installation is completed, you can verify that the program has been installed correctly by running the following code through the terminal.
```sh
tkltest-unit --help
tkltest-ui --help
```
If any problems arise, you can find more information [here](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle-test-generator-cli/blob/main/doc/installation.md).





## Example Test Generation With Tackle-Test
After Tackle-Test is installed, a sample configuration file is provided in the file to see the test generation process. It may be useful to experience Tackle-Test for the first time through this sample program.
1- tackle-test-generator-cli/test/data/irs/tkltest_config.toml file is opened.
2- Although many variables in this file are set for the sample project, you need to find out where the JDK is on your computer and assign it to the java_jdk_home variable.
3- Open the terminal and enter the following code

```sh
/usr/libexec/java_home
```
When the Enter key is pressed, you will get output as follows.
```sh
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```
4- The file address we obtained above is assigned to the java_jdk_home variable.
```groovy
java_jdk_home = "/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-11.jdk/Contents/Home"
```
5-  The code mentioned below is run via the terminal, thus test files are generated according to the configuration in the `tkltest_config.toml` file.
```sh
tkltest-unit --config-file ./test/data/irs/tkltest_config.toml --verbose generate ctd-amplified
```
6- After generating the tests, you can execute the tests you generated by running the code below.
```sh
tkltest-unit --config-file ./test/data/irs/tkltest_config.toml --verbose execute
```
The tests produced can be accessed by going `tackle-test-generator-cli/tkltest-output-unit-irs/irs-ctd-amplified-tests`,
and you can also view the test reports created with JACOCO and JUnit from `irs-tkltest-reports folder`.
